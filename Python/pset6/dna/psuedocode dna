#sys module gives access to sys.argv for command-line arguments
#read a text file f using open(filename), you can read its content
# using f.read()

#len(s) get you length of string s, s[i:j] takes the string s,
# returns the substring with all chars
#from ith char up to (but not including) jth

# open CSV file and DNA seq, read contents into memory

# For each STR, compute the longest run of consecutive repeats in the DNA seq

# Compare the STR counts against each row in the CSV file

#1. opening files


1. Read file
2. Extract string from header and search for sequence
